# Sign Language Translation

## Abstract

The purpose of this project is to research and develop a system for local Deaf-Mute Sign Language Translation by converting
a video to frames, detecting the hand in it, classifying and translating that particular frame so that
it may prove a stepping stone towards including the deaf-mute community in the ongoing digital
revolution of life and hence allowing them to benefit from it as well.

## Introduction and Background

A gesture-based system is used by the deaf-mute community all over the world to communicate.Unfortunately, this system is not internationalized and has a lot of localized versions all over the world. Due to this, the deaf-mute people have major problems in communication. In Pakistan, particularly, this becomes a great challenge because there is almost no standardization of the sign language. Furthermore, the usage of sign language requires training not only for the speaker but also for the listener (the other person).

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is now being used to facilitate disabled people in the
community with things such as the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance being
enforced to electronic media as well. A particular aspect of the gesture-based system used for communication by the deaf-mute community is the hand-gesture system. The hand-gesture is a very natural way for communication. Because of this, researchers from academia as well as the industry are working on different applications to make this sort of interaction more easy, natural and convenient without requiring the users to wear additional hardware devices.

Our project consists of conducting a research on how to translate the sign language presented in the video format to textual representation. We will then apply our methodology to develop a web app to accomplish the task where the user of the system will provide a video that will be split into frames and the translation process will be carried.

## Motivation and Need

The digital era has revolutionized the life of humans all over the world. Being part of it is becoming more of a need these days than a mere luxury. There is a need for all of humanity to benefit from it, especially the otherwise less-able or disable people.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) can be used as a powerful tool for making the life of the deafmute community more easy by providing a means for their communication with the normal society. Sign Language is the major tool used by this community to communicate with the rest of the world. By using computer-based techniques, we can create a better way for them to communicate.

Deaf-mute people face serious communication problems which leads them to live an isolated life in the society. The proposed system will focus on acting as an intelligent translator between a deafmute person and a normal person and can thus be a communication path between the two. As a result, such a system will make way not only for the deaf-mute people to communicate so that they donâ€™t feel isolated but it will also allow them to be active members of the society and perform various valuable jobs suited to them.
